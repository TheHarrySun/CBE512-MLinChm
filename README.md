# CBE 512 Repository
This repository is a companion for the course "CBE 512: Machine Learning in Chemical Science and Engineering" at Princeton University. 
For my purposes as a student in this course, I am using this repository as a way to display my work in coding assignments and demonstrating
my experience leveraging Python machine learning libraries such as tensorflow, keras, scikit-learn, and scipy while also applying them 
to chemical and biological research contexts by using libraries such as RDkit and Biopython.
