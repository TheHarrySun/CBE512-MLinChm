# CBE 512 Repository
This repository is a companion for the course "CBE 512: Machine Learning in Chemical Science and Engineering" at Princeton University. 
Currently, its primary function is to host content, such as datasets, so that it can be easily downloaded.
Over time, it will be further developed to host all important course content and to launch an independent publicly accessible course website.
Students at Princeton University who are taking the course will still need to utilize Canvas.
